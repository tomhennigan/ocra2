This is a simple emulator for the (fake) microprocessor described by OCR in their A2 Electronics exam (until 2009). It reads a binary file with instructions and runs the program on the host machine in an emulated environment.

During the emulation the contents of the registers can be printed (check the usage for print flags). The emulation can be set as step through, delayed, or run end-to-end.
